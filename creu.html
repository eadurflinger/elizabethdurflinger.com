                        Today our team met and I gave a talk on GitHub and how I propose we use it. This covered the basics of version control and organization. Once everyone was on the same page with GitHub, Dr. Yu announced that we have formally been granted permission to collect data from a deals website and will start data collection in November. This has been blocked for several weeks so it was a relief that the admins of the deals website granted us permissions. We decided that we will not be meeting next week as a group due to Halloween. I will be meeting with Dr. Yu on Tuesday to learn more about the scraping process and how we will be organizing our data. He will be showing me other examples of data collection and manipulation. Dr. Kerns will be sendin the teams articles for literary review which we will read in preparation for our next meeting on November 7th.

                        This week during our meeting, the team and mentors discussed the progress we made with our programs. Dr. Kerns made a program that worked well and displayed ranked support and confidence as well as association rules. Our team also wanted to be able to access Dr. Kern's code as an example so I helped with setting us all up with a github organization <a href="https://github.com/YSU-CREU-2018">YSU-CREU-2018</a>. Throuhgout the meeting I realized that it would be necessary to host a GitHub workshop to get everyone up to speed on using GitHub and the benefits of version control. Maddie reserved us a room for next week where I will give this presentation. For this week I will prepare a talk on GitHub and look into how to organize our practice programs that we have been working on for the past couple of weeks.

                        This week, I was able to meet with a software developer through Code Youngstown that was able to help me out with my environment issues on my computer. I will be able to run Python files on my computer without issue.

                        Over the weekend I was able to purchase a new Macbook Pro. Configuring it posed some issues. I am no longer able to run the program in the terminal. I hope to solve this problem by our next meeting on October 17th. I am 90% sure that I am missing a installation. I plan to confide in a professional python dev in the Youngstown area to help me solve this problem. Once I am able to iterate I will be able to see if the changes I made to my program work.

                        Our meeting this week went well, we have all made some for of progress on the program. Most of our issues that we are comming across are technical IDE and dependancy issues. I will be looking into our teams techincal problems and hopefully help fix these issues by our next meeting.

                        Our meeting this week consisted of our members going over our progress with the association rules program. Mine was running but due to my computer breaking I was unable to make progress on getting the data to be displayed correctly. Since I update this blog from editing my personal website (not a 3rd party Wordpress etc) I am updating a week late. I did some more reading into implementing the apriori algorithm and data science. Our assignemt remains to work on the program and get it to display in a better way. I hoped to purchase a new laptop so that I could continue working on the project as well as work and school.

                        At this weeks meeting (September 19th), our team met with Dr. Kerns to review our progress. We discussed that we will not be using lift to calculate the association rules and that the next step of the project will be to right programs in Python to create association rules for the small data set that we have been given as specified in my last post. I researched the Apriori algorthim how to implement it. From there I created a program that reads from a csv file and creates a set of association rules based on the given information. I need to work on displaying this information in a more user friendly way.
                        <br>
                        This is how it is currently displayed:

                        <br>
                        The goal is to have this displayed by association rule in a readable format.

                        This post pertains to rating matricies and calculating their lift. Lift is defined as how likely one deal will be liked while another is liked. A lift of 1 implies no association between the two deals and a lift greater than one implies that deal one is likely to be bought with deal two. Lift{A=>E} = (Support{A,E})/(Support{A}*Support{E}).<br><br>So Lift{A=>E} = (2/4)/(2/4 * 3/4) = (2/4)/(6/4) = 1/3<br><br>This means that that E is not likely to be liked when A is liked.

                        This evening, our CREU Research team met to discuss our goals and milestones. During this meeting we reviewed the association rules, support, and confidence. Dr. Yu assisted us with understanding the concepts of support and confidence and how to calculate the values of each base upon the ratings matrix. Moving on in familiarizing ourselves with reccommender systems, our assignment for this upcoming week is to calculate the lift based on the ratings matrix provided and to research the Apriori Algorithm.

                        On September 5th, our CREU Research team met to discuss our goals and milestones. Dr. Lucy Kerns invited us all to a Slack workspace for our team, and we joined the main CREU Slack as well. All of our members had set up the basis for their blogs and read over the suggested readings. We discussed association rules, support, confidence, and lift. In order to grasp a more solid understanding of these concepts, our assignment was to calcuate a list of asscociation rules and their corresponding support and confidence values based on a binary ratings matrix. We are to discuss our findings with the group at the next meeting on September 12th.

                        This next section pertains to rating matricies and calculating their association rules as well as the corresponding confidence and support values. For example, the support of the statement column A => E would be 2/4 and the condidence would be 2/2. For the statement B => D the support would be 1/4 and the confidence would be 1/2.

                        Our CREU Team met for our first meeting on August 29th, 2018. This includes Dr. Feng Yu, Dr. Lucy Kerns, the faculty advisors, as well as Olivia, Allyssa, Maddie, and myself. In this meeting we discussed our strategies for approaching the requirements of the project and came to the following timeline. In September our team will focus on familiarizing ourselves with the reccomender system, association rules, and matricies. Our faculty advisors will be providing us with reading materials to guide us in our learning. In October through December we will be collecting data, which will be Dr. Yu's field of expertise and keeping a blog of our progress. Next semester will be the bulk of the programming section of this research where we will be making a frontend interface for a deals site and making a reccomender system.<br><br>It has been decided that our team will have weekly meetings, every Wednesday from 4:00PM - 5:00PM in Lincoln Building on YSU's campus. In preparation for our next meeting our team should have created a blog and read over the reading selections provided to us by our faculty advisors.
